A “bad credit” personal loan is for those whose credit score is low, or who have a short credit history. These loans do not require collateral (such as a car or home) but do require a credit check.

The interest rate for these may not be low. Bankrate lists several loans that have interest rates that could be as low as 6.7% but could go as high as 36%. With a poor credit score, you’re going to be closer to 36% interest than 6.7%. In addition, these loans usually charge origination fees, which increases the cost.

Personal loans can be used to buy groceries or pay bills, if you are in a financial pinch. Though you can borrow larger amounts of money than you can with payday loans, the main negatives of these loans are the costs. It’s vital to understand the interest rate and other costs and what your monthly payment to repay the loan will be.

The better your credit the better your interest rate, though a cosigner willing to put his or her name on the loan can help with qualifying and the interest rate.
