There are many negatives to payday loans, chief among them the cost. Consider that 18 states have “limited” interest rates on payday loans to 36%. That “limit” is a staggeringly high rate, especially when you consider that the mortgage rate is only 7.4% and the interest rate for credit cards is around 24%.

But that’s not even the worst news about the cost of payday loans. Typically, payday loans charge a fee per $100 borrowed, and that fee is $15-$30. That comes out to an astronomical 399% APR!

These high costs lead to struggles in repaying the loan, especially given the time limit to repay can be as short as two weeks. That leads to default, when the borrower does not repay, which leads to late payment fees and decreased credit and credit scores.

In addition, some payday loans come from predatory lenders. If a borrower can’t repay the loan, instead of offering some way to help, a payday lender may force more borrowing at a higher fee, which only deepens the debt spiral we all are trying to avoid.
