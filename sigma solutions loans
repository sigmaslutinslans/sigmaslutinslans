Payday loans offer a fast but expensive and sometimes dangerous way to borrow money.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) calls a payday loan a “short-term, high-cost loan” that typically must be repaid on a person’s next payday or no more than four weeks from the date of the loan.

Though states have different laws, payday loans are typically available at store-front businesses that offer an “easy” way to get cash at a very high price.

Payday loans are mainly used by people in desperate need of money. That could include those who have fallen on hard times through misfortune, or those who have squandered their money.

Those who may need money to feed their children or to heat their home may turn to this method of borrowing. They may gain cash quickly, but it will come at a very high price – and often will lead to a spiral of growing financial struggles.
